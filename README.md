# Horiseon-Week-1-Challenge

## Description

This site opens up the Horiseon home page. This is where you can learn about search engine optimization (SEO). I refactored the code in this project to make it more accessible. This is an example of SEO. I learned that by using proper semantic guidelines, a page can load quicker, be more accessible, and be easier to find when using a search engine to look for it. THe link to the search engine optimization section was also fixed.

## Usage

You can use the three navigation link headers to navigate throughout the page. Each link take you to their corresponding section. This webpage can be used to refresh and study SEO properties. It can also be used as a homepage for the fictional company of Horiseon.
